## Problem situation
Greenhouse gas emissions based on diet

### What is the problem? Why does it matter?
Greenhouse emissions is on the rise. And food/agriculuture contributes a significant portion to the total emissions. There a lot of people who change their diets based on enviornmental emissions. Individual decisions on food diets may not be substantiated by data.

### Stakeholders
Both consumers and producers (aka every single person alive)

### How will it be addressed? Research questions

### Setting
This is an issue that exists everywhere but we are thinking of just analyzing the United States for now

### Values and Tensions in play
Financial cost of food for consumer and producers
impact of global warming and the land that produces the food

### policy and ethic elements
potential use for labeling products that are based on emissions

### Problem: Food contributes a big portion of greenhouse gas emissions

# Why does it matter???
Global warming is bad ... duh...
heavily impact the food industry
species are going extinct
earth is going to be a lot warmer

# how we will address Problem
reccomend diets that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions
backed up by Data. Could be implemented by the FDA or department of agriculture by providing reliable food products so that consumers are made aware of their carbon footprints.

# What is our current food consumpution looking like?
#  What is the optimal diet to reduce greenhouse gas Emissions?

# possible data set

# visualizations
diets in various regions of the world...
scale world of how much impact each place has
comparing graph... greenhouse gas vs food and comparing these foods

# team collaboration
Every Thursday from 10:30-12:30.
