## **Problem Situation**
_**The food and agriculture sector contributes a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions. As greenhouse gas emissions has continued to proliferate, there has been an acceleration towards catastrophic global warming. The advocacy of convenience, coupled with the continual advancements in technology have allowed for a culture of complacency. It is an ethical issue to consume without recognition of ones impact. Despite this, a lack of financial motivation for both producers and consumers in the market will prevent change.**_

## **What Is The Problem?**
_**As the population of the world increases and food consumption habits remain stagnant, the amount of preventable greenhouse gases produced by the food and agriculture sector becomes staggering. Superfluous amounts of greenhouse gases are generated due to massive food waste, excessive consumption of livestock, and the conversion of non-agricultural lands to agricultural land.[5] The extremely high consumption of red-meat in particular is a keystone issue. There are excessive inefficiencies throughout the chain of production due to red-meat consumption.**_

## **Why Does It Matter?**
_**The proliferation of gases will accelerate the progress towards the brink of disaster due to climate change. Global warming could radically change weather patterns, coastlines, and ultimately degrade the standard of living across the globe. The obvious impact of global warming would be a general increase in the mean temperature across the globe. This impact itself is very dangerous due to changes in precipitation, causing mass droughts and heatwaves in many areas. This would also lead to the rise in sea level, increase in hurricane intensity, and displacement along coastlines.**_

## **How It Will Be Addressed?**
_**A reduction in food waste and focusing on eating low on the food chain would be a necessary step towards sustainable living. A long term solution begins with a recognition and adaptation of the human diet, requiring a transition towards a largely plant-based diet with small allowances. A data-based analysis and clear visual approach would be a powerful method of promoting adoption by a general population. Simplicity and instructional guidance are key methods of changing population behavior.**_

## **Research Questions**
_**1. What is the status of our current food consumption with regards to environmental impact?**_

_**2. What is the optimal diet to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?**_

## **Possible Data Set**
#### **Dataset 1**
_**Systematic review of greenhouse gas emissions for different fresh food categories**_
https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0959652616303584?token=C1B9682ECFDECE53AECCB06CB4D6BEBC25A4050980D1CB8ED13C2C6C5D6D0D4D452BBE5DA18E8473B6D25EC6DF229AC9
_**This dataset provides a list of different types of food and each of their global warming
potentials (GWPs). A food's GWP is determined by the amount of carbon dioxide equivalents
it emits when consumed. The datset contains information on flours, grains, pulses, nuts, dairy,
meat, fruits, and vegetables and is compiled in the afformentioned article by Stephen Clune,
Enda Crossin, and Karli Verghese.
No. Observations: 1732
No. Attributes: 10**_

#### **Dataset 2**
_**Greenhouse gas emissions by sector**_
https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions
_**Our World In Data provides a detailed and thorough analysis of total greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions by-sector for nearly every country in the world between 1961 and 2014. We plan
to use this data as a way of visualizing emissions from agriculture for each country. GHG
emissions are calculated as CO2 equivalents.
No. Observations: 13953
No. Attributes: 12**_

## **Information Visualizations**
_**Visualizations presents an accessible way to display our data and gain a grasp on big data. For our research question, we believe that our message would be be conveyed by displaying statistics of each country using color codes. And having a bar graph that would compare different diets.**_

## **Team Collaboration**
_**Meet every Thursday from 10:30-12:30 because this is the only time that works for all of us. We will separate the work equally and based off of everyones strength. Everyone will have their roles and involvement in this project.**_
