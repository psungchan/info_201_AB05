## Problem situation
Greenhouse gas emissions based on diet

## What is the problem? Why does it matter?
Greenhouse emissions is on the rise. And food/agriculuture contributes a significant portion to the total emissions. There a lot of people who change their diets based on enviornmental emissions. Individual decisions on food diets may not be substantiated by data.

## Stakeholders
Both consumers and producers (aka every single person alive)

## Setting
This is an issue that exists everywhere but we are thinking of just analyzing the United States for now

## Values and Tensions in play
Financial cost of food for consumer and producers
impact of global warming and the land that produces the food

## policy and ethic elements
potential use for labeling products that are based on emissions

## Problem: Food contributes a big portion of greenhouse gas emissions

## Why does it matter?
Global warming is bad ... duh...
heavily impact the food industry
species are going extinct
earth is going to be a lot warmer

## How we will address problem
reccomend diets that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions
backed up by Data. Could be implemented by the FDA or department of agriculture by providing reliable food products so that consumers are made aware of their carbon footprints.

## Research Questions
What is our current food consumpution looking like?
What is the optimal diet to reduce greenhouse gas Emissions?

## Possible Data Set
#### Dataset 1
Systematic review of greenhouse gas emissions for different fresh food categories
https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0959652616303584?token=C1B9682ECFDECE53AECCB06CB4D6BEBC25A4050980D1CB8ED13C2C6C5D6D0D4D452BBE5DA18E8473B6D25EC6DF229AC9
This dataset provides a list of different types of food and each of their global warming
potentials (GWPs). A food's GWP is determined by the amount of carbon dioxide equivalents
it emits when consumed. The datset contains information on flours, grains, pulses, nuts, dairy,
meat, fruits, and vegetables and is compiled in the afformentioned article by Stephen Clune,
Enda Crossin, and Karli Verghese.
No. Observations: 1732
No. Attributes: 10

#### Dataset 2
Greenhouse gas emissions by sector
https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions
Our World In Data provides a detailed and thorough analysis of total greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions by-sector for nearly every country in the world between 1961 and 2014. We plan
to use this data as a way of visualizing emissions from agriculture for each country. GHG
emissions are calculated as CO2 equivalents.
No. Observations: 13953
No. Attributes: 12

## Information Visualizations
Visualizations presents an accessible way to display our data and gain a grasp on big data. For our research question, we believe that our message would be be conveyed by displaying statistics of each country using color codes. And having a bar graph that would compare different diets.

Figure 1. This graphic display of the world displays the CO2 emissions of each country. For our project, we hope to do something similar where we display the country's diets on the map. (European Union Joint Research Centre) [1]

## Team Collaboration
(whoever is gonna work on this should add a little more....)
Every Thursday from 10:30-12:30.
